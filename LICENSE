The Agama library uses routines from GSL and is therefore available
under the GNU GPL license.
However, the original source code of Agama itself is not subject to GPL
and is provided under the less restrictive BSD or MIT licenses.

For the python interface, Agama uses pybind11 and so the python interface is subject to the following license:
